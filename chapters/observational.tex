\chapter{The Observational Calculus of Constructions}
\labch{layout}
\label{sec:type-theory-with}

% \sideremark{The \SetoidCC acronym stands for the ``Observational Calculus of 
% Constructions''.}
In this chapter we present our system \SetoidCC, which is a flavor of 
Altenkirch and McBride's observational type theory \cite{altenkirchAl:plpv2007}.
% 
\SetoidCC extends Martin-Löf Type Theory with support for an observational 
equality, impredicative propositions, and quotient types while preserving the
computational properties of \MLTT (see \cref{ch:metatheory}).

We start in \cref{sec:generalities} with some generalities about the system, then we delve 
into a detailed description of the typing rules in \cref{sec:typing-rules}, and 
finally we conclude with a few examples that showcase the new features of 
\SetoidCC in \cref{sec:examples}.

\section{Generalities}
\label{sec:generalities}

\subsection{Constructions and Propositions}

\SetoidCC separates types into two layers: a proof-relevant layer for 
\emph{constructions} and a proof-irrelevant layer for \emph{propositions}. 

The proof-relevant types inhabit the universe hierarchy \( \Type_i \).
% 
This layer functions exactly like usual Martin-Löf Type Theory, and
contains familiar types
\sideremark{In fact all \MLTT types are available in \SetoidCC, and the usual 
typing rules and equations still hold true.}
such as the type of natural numbers, \( \Pi \)-types, \( \Sigma \)-types or 
universes; but also new types such as subset types and quotient types.
% 
Generally speaking, proof-relevant objects correspond to mathematical 
constructions and programs.

The second layer corresponds to the impredicative universe of propositions 
\( \sProp \), which behaves rather differently.
% 
Indeed, propositions are \emph{definitionally proof-irrelevant types}, which 
means that any two inhabitants of a type \( \tm{A}{\sProp} \) are convertible
simply by virtue of having type \( A \). 
% 
This corresponds to the universe of strict propositions
\( \varsProp \) described in~\sidecitet{gilbert:hal-01859964} and implemented 
in \Coq and \Lean.
% 
Propositions contain no computational information whatsoever, but they may be 
used to express logical constraints on proof-relevant objects.
% 
Examples of propositions will include True, False, logical connectors and the 
observational equality.

These two layers are far from being hermetically sealed, though. 
% 
The complex interactions between the observational equality and the 
proof-relevant layer fundamentally changes the behavior of the theory, so
that it becomes possible to prove
\defnote{function extensionality}{Recall that function extensionality means that
pointwise equal functions are in fact equal: \( (\forall x, f\ x = g\ x) \to f = g \).} 
for the \emph{inductive equality} in the proof-relevant layer of \SetoidCC!

\subsection{The Observational Equality}

A central feature of \SetoidCC is that every proof-relevant
% 
\sideremark{Proof-irrelevant propositions, on their part, do not need to be equipped 
with an equality relation: since any two inhabitants are convertible, they
would always be equal by reflexivity.}
% 
type \( A \) comes equipped with a proof-irrelevant \emph{observational equality} 
type, that we write \( {\Obseq[A]{t}{u}} \).

As suggested by its name, this equality is built around the idea that two 
objects should be identified when they behave similarly with respect to all 
obervations we can make on them.
% 
For instance, the observations we can make on a function \( f : \Nat \to \Nat \) 
basically amount to applying \( f \) to some number \( n \), and computing the
result. 
% 
Thus, two integer functions \( f \) and \( g \) are observationally equal 
when \( \Obseq[\Nat]{f\ n}{g\ n} \) for all \( n : \Nat \),
which is the principle of function extensionality.

In this regard, the observational equality is similar to the univalent equality 
found in Homotopy Type Theory \sidecite{hottbook}. 
% 
But it is also fundamentally different: 
% 
by virtue of being a proof-irrelevant proposition, the observational equality 
validates the principle of Uniqueness of Identity Proofs (\UIP), while the 
equality of \HoTT equips types with the complex structure of a higher groupoid.
% 
In other words, \SetoidCC is a language for set-like objects and set-based 
mathematics, not higher mathematics.
% 
In exchange for the comfortable simplicity of \UIP, the observational equality
is not univalent, and in particular it does not identify isomorphic types.

From a computational perspective, the observational equality behaves very 
differently from the usual Martin-Löf Identity Type.
% 
The equality type \( \Obseq[A]{t}{u} \) should be understood 
as an \emph{eliminator} that computes by reducing the type \( A \) to its 
normal form, and then pattern-matches on it to produce the equality 
relation which is appropriate for \( A \). For instance, if \( A \) happens
to be a function type, then the observational equality will reduce to the
statement of function extensionality:
\[
	\Obseq[\Fun{A}{B}]{f}{g} \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \Depfun{A}{\Obseq[B]{f\ x}{g\ x}}.
\]
Likewise, all the other type formers have corresponding computation rules for the
observational equality.

\subsection{Eliminating Equality with Type Casting}

For the observational equality to be of any use, we need a way to
use it in constructions and proofs: 
% 
\sideremark{This principle is called the Leibniz rule.}
% 
from an inhabitant of \( P\ a \) and a proof of \( \Obseq{a}{b} \), we should 
be able to obtain an inhabitant of \( P\ b \).
% 
To this end, \SetoidCC provides two primitive eliminators \( \transportName \)
and \( \castName \).

Elimination of equalities into the proof-irrelevant layer is done with 
\( \transportName \). 
% 
Since the result is computationally irrelevant, this operator is not required 
to satisfy any kind of equation -- in the proof-irrelevant world, all 
equations are true as soon as they are well-typed.
% 
Thus \( \transportName \) is merely an axiom that postulates the Leibniz
rule for propositional predicates \( P : A \to \sProp \).
% 
We can use it to derive important properties of the observational equality, 
such as the fact that it is an equivalence relation, or that it is preserved
by functions:
\sideremark{The variables \( A, B, x, y \) are implicitly quantified over the 
appropriate types, which we omit to avoid clutter.}
\[
\metaop{ap} : \Depfun[f]{A \to B}{\Fun{\Obseq[A]{x}{y}}{\Obseq[B]{f\ x}{f\ y}}}.
\]

On the other hand, \( \castName \) eliminates equalities into the 
proof-relevant layer by allowing to cast terms between two observationally
equal types.
% 
Given a proof \( e : \Obseq[\Type]{A}{B} \) and an inhabitant \( t : A \), the
term \( \cast{A}{B}{e}{t} \) behaves like an eliminator that reduces the types
\( A \) and \( B \) to normal form, and then computes by pattern-matching on 
their head constructors.
% 
For instance, if \( A \) and \( B \) are two function types, then the cast
will reduce to a function that casts back and forth:
\sideremark{In this computation, \( e \) is a proof of 
\( {\Obseq{\Fun{A}{B}}{\Fun{A'}{B'}}} \), which is actually convertible to
\( {(\Obseq{A}{A'})} \land {(\Obseq{B}{B'})}. \) We write \( e_1 \) and 
\( e_2 \) for its projections.}
\begin{align*}
& \cast{\Fun{A}{B}}{\Fun{A'}{B'}}{e}{f} \\
& \qquad \Longrightarrow \quad
\lam{A'}{\cast{B}{B'}{e_2}{f\ \cast{A'}{A}{e_1}{x}}}
\end{align*}
% 
Just like with the observational equality, every type constructor comes with
rules that describe the behavior of \( \castName \) on its elements.
% 
Note that the equality proof \( e \) plays no computational role, and is just
here to ensure that the cast is consistent.

The \( \castName \) operator, despite its apparent simplicity, is in fact enough
to derive the \( J \) eliminator of \MLTT. Indeed, the \( J \) eliminator is
equivalent to the Leibniz rule and the contractibility of singletons 
\sidecite{hottbook}, but the contractibility of singletons is implied by 
proof irrelevance of the equality. Finally, the Leibniz rule is a consequence 
of \( \metaop{ap} \) and \( \castName \).

	\end{small}
	\caption{Syntax of \SetoidCC}
	\label{fig:syntax}
\end{figure}

The syntax of the sorts, contexts, terms and types of \SetoidTT is
specified in \cref{fig:syntax}.
%
The theory features cumulative dependent functions (noted $\Depfunannotated{A}{B}{s}{i}{j}$) with
\( \eta \)-equality, natural numbers, as well as proof-irrelevant dependent
sums (noted $\Exists{A}{B}$), a proof-irrelevant empty type (noted
$\Empty$) and unit type (noted $\Unit$).
%
When \( B \) does not depend on \( A \), we write \( \Fun{A}{B} \) instead of
\( \Depfun{A}{B} \), and \( \Prod{A}{B} \) instead of \( \Exists{A}{B} \). The capture-avoiding
substitution of a variable \( x \) in a term \( A \) by the term \( t \) is noted
\( \subst{B}{t} \).
%
\SetoidTT can also be extended with more primitives such as quotients or general inductive types,
but we defer the treatment of those to \cref{sec:extens-quot-id} to better focus on the
treatment of equality in the theory.

\subsection{typing}

The typing rules of \SetoidTT are presented in \cref{fig:SetoidTT-typing}.
%
They are based on four kinds of judgments: \( \wfctx{\Gamma} \) (well-formedness
of a context), \( \tytmannotated{\Gamma}{t}{A}{s}{i} \) (typing of a term),
\( \eqtmannotated{\Gamma}{t}{u}{A}{s}{i} \) (convertibility of terms), and
\( \redannotated{\Gamma}{t}{u}{A}{s}{i} \) (weak-head reduction of
relevant terms).
%
To avoid clutter, we will omit the \( {}^{s,i} \) annotations that
denote the sort and level of a
type as that can generally be inferred from the context.\footnote{The
  interested reader may look at the \Agda formalization where all
  annotations have been made explicit.}
%
Similarly, we will often omit the annotations on the dependent function
type and simply write $\Depfun{A}{B}$ ; except when the annotations are explicitly
required to understand a rule.
%
In all the judgments, $s$ denotes either $\Type$ or $\sProp[]$.


\subsection{Generic rules and universes}

Rules~\nameref{infrule:ctx-nil}, \nameref{infrule:ctx-cons} and \nameref{infrule:var} describe the
usual formation of contexts and typing of variables. Rule~\nameref{infrule:conv}
stipulates that type checking is done modulo conversion of types.
%
The formation rule for universes (Rule~\nameref{infrule:univ}) states
that both \( \Type_i \) and \( \sProp[i] \) are relevant types. It is natural
for \( \sProp \) to be proof-relevant, since its inhabitants are
types which are not convertible to one another despite being proof-irrelevant.

\subsection{Dependent products}

The formation of dependent products between a domain and a codomain that have
different sorts and universe levels is allowed. The resulting type has the same
relevance as the codomain, and a universe level that is higher than both the level of
the domain and the level of the codomain.
% 
\begin{mathpar}
    \inferrule[$\Pi$-Form]
        {%\tytm{\Gamma}{A}{\Univ}
            \tytm{\extctxannotated{\Gamma}{A}{\Univ}}{B}{\Univ '}}
        {\tytm{\Gamma}{\Depfunannotated{A}{B}{s}{s}{s'}}{\piRel{\Univ}{\Univ '}}}
        {}
    \ilabel{infrule:pi-form}
\end{mathpar}
%
The sort of the domain and the levels of both the domain and the codomain are
collected as annotations to the dependent function type for the convenience of the
type checking algorithm.
%
Note that the introduction of cumulativity in the formation of
dependent products is a necessary complication of \SetoidTT as
the rules that provide us with propositional extensionality and
function extensionality can only be well-typed in the presence of cumulativity.

\begin{mathpar}
	\inferrule[Fun]
        {\tytmannotated{\extctxannotated{\Gamma}{A}{\Univ}}{t}{B}{\Univ'}}
        {\tytmannotated{\Gamma}{\lam{A}{t}}{\Depfun{A}{B}}{\piRel{\Univ}{\Univ '}}}
    \ilabel{infrule:pi-intro}
    \and
    \inferrule[App]
        {\tytmannotated{\Gamma}{t}{\Depfun{A}{B}}{\piRel{\Univ}{\Univ '}}
            \\ \tytmannotated{\Gamma}{u}{A}{\Univ}}
        {\tytmannotated{\Gamma}{t\ u}{\subst{B}{u}}{\Univ '}}
    \ilabel{infrule:pi-elim}
\end{mathpar}

Rules~\nameref{infrule:pi-intro} and \nameref{infrule:pi-elim} are the
usual rules of $\lambda$-abstraction and application. Note that the sort and level annotation
are implicit as they can be inferred from the premises.

\subsection{Dependent conjunctions}

\SetoidTT features proof-irrelevant dependent sums. They are required
to describe the behavior of observational equality between two
dependent function types. We do not need them to be cumulative
so we keep the formation rule as simple as possible.

\begin{mathpar}
    \inferrule[$\exists$-Form]
        {%\tytm{\Gamma}{A}{\sProp_i}
            \tytm{\extctxannotated{\Gamma}{A}{\sProp}}{B}{\sProp_i}}
        {\tytm{\Gamma}{\Exists{A}{B}}{\sProp_i}}
        % {\scriptstyle \substack{i \le k \\ j \le k}}
    \ilabel{infrule:exists-form}
\end{mathpar}

We give a negative presentation of dependent sums with one introduction
rule (Rule~\nameref{infrule:pair}) and two projections (Rules~\nameref{infrule:fst} and \nameref{infrule:snd}).

\begin{mathpar}
	\inferrule[Pair]
        {\tytm{\extctxannotated{\Gamma}{A}{\sProp}}{B}{\sProp_i} 
            \\ \tytmannotated{\Gamma}{t}{A}{\sProp}
            \\ \tytmannotated{\Gamma}{u}{\subst{B}{t}}{\sProp}}
        {\tytmannotated{\Gamma}{\pair{t}{u}}{\Exists{A}{B}}{\sProp}}
    \ilabel{infrule:pair}
    \and
    \inferrule[Fst]
        {\tytmannotated{\Gamma}{t}{\Exists{A}{B}}{\sProp}}
        {\tytmannotated{\Gamma}{\fst{t}}{A}{\sProp}}
    \ilabel{infrule:fst}
    \and
    \inferrule[Snd]
        {\tytmannotated{\Gamma}{t}{\Exists{A}{B}}{\sProp}}
        {\tytmannotated{\Gamma}{\snd{t}}{\subst{B}{\fst{t}}}{\sProp}}
    \ilabel{infrule:snd}
\end{mathpar}

Note that because of proof irrelevance, the negative and positive presentations
are completely equivalent, and we do not need any rule to account for the
computational behavior of projections, nor $\eta$-equality. This is because any well-typed
equality between two inhabitants of a proof-irrelevant type is proven by reflexivity
(modulo Rule~\nameref{infrule:conv}).


\subsection{Natural numbers}

Strictly speaking, all inductive types could be excluded from the core of \SetoidTT , and be
considered as extensions. However, we decided to treat the example of natural numbers as we
feel it is both very simple and a good illustration.

The type $\Nat$ comes with a formation rule \nameref{infrule:nat-form}, constructors $\zero$
(Rule~\nameref{infrule:zero}) and $\sucName$  (Rule~\nameref{infrule:suc})
and an elimination/induction principle given by Rule~\nameref{infrule:nat-elim}.

\begin{mathpar}
    \inferrule[$\Nat$-Form]
        {\wfctx{\Gamma}}
        {\tytm{\Gamma}{\Nat}{\Type_0}}
    \ilabel{infrule:nat-form}
    \and
    \inferrule[Zero]
        {\wfctx{\Gamma}}
        {\tytmannotated{\Gamma}{\zero}{\Nat}{\Type_0}}
    \ilabel{infrule:zero}
    \and
    \inferrule[Suc]
        {\tytmannotated{\Gamma}{n}{\Nat}{\Type_0}}
        {\tytmannotated{\Gamma}{\suc{n}}{\Nat}{\Type_0}}
    \ilabel{infrule:suc}
    \and
    \inferrule[$\Nat$-Elim]
        {\tytmannotated{\Gamma}{t_0}{A\ \zero}{\Univ}
            \\ \tytmannotated{\Gamma}{t_S}{\Depfun[n]{\Nat}{\Fun{A\ n}{A\ (\suc{n})}}}{\Univ}
            \\ \tytmannotated{\Gamma}{n}{\Nat}{\Type_0}}
        {\tytmannotated{\Gamma}{\natrec{A}{t_0}{t_S}{n}}{A\ n}{\Univ}}
    \ilabel{infrule:nat-elim}
\end{mathpar}

Since we do not require cumulativity for the type of natural numbers, we decided to only allow it
in the lowest universe \( \Type_0 \), but it could be made to inhabit all relevant universes without
added difficulty.
%
Extensions to other inductive types and quotient types are presented
in \cref{sec:extens-quot-id}.

\subsection{Empty and Unit type}

To encode respectively the true equalities and the absurd equalities, \SetoidTT features the
unit type $\Unit$ and the empty type $\Empty$.
%
Besides its formation rule (Rule~\nameref{infrule:empty-form}), the empty type comes
with an elimination principle (Rule~\nameref{infrule:empty-elim}) that can eliminate it into
both proof-irrelevant and proof-relevant types.

\begin{mathpar}
    \inferrule[$\Empty$-Form]
        {\wfctx{\Gamma}}
        {\tytm{\Gamma}{\Empty}{\sProp_i}}
    \ilabel{infrule:empty-form}
    \and
    \inferrule[$\Empty$-Elim]
        {\tytm{\Gamma}{A}{\Univ_i}
            \\ \tytmannotated{\Gamma}{t}{\Empty}{\sProp}}
        {\tytmannotated{\Gamma}{\emptyrec{A}{t}}{A}{\Univ_i}}
    \ilabel{infrule:empty-elim}
\end{mathpar}
%
In \MLTT with a proof irrelevant universe hierarchy, this constitutes the unique
connection between the proof-irrelevant and relevant types. This means
that the only way to use information from a proof-irrelevant term to
build a proof-relevant term is by using a proof of $\Empty$, which
amounts to proving that actually we are in an inaccessible branch or
impossible case.
%
In \SetoidTT however, there is another very different way of using
proof irrelevant information to build a proof relevant term, by
transporting (or casting) along a proof of equality.

The unit type on the other hand only requires a formation rule
(Rule~\nameref{infrule:unit-form}) and a constructor~$\unit$
(Rule~\nameref{infrule:unit-intro}).
It does not require an eliminator, since the usual one can be derived from proof
irrelevance.
% 
\begin{mathpar}
    \inferrule[$\Unit$-Form]
        {\wfctx{\Gamma}}
        {\tytm{\Gamma}{\Unit}{\sProp_i}}
    \ilabel{infrule:unit-form}
    \and
    \inferrule[$\Unit$-Intro]
        {\wfctx{\Gamma}}
        {\tytmannotated{\Gamma}{\unit}{\Unit}{\sProp}}
    \ilabel{infrule:unit-intro}
\end{mathpar}
% 
Equivalently, we could have defined the unit type as \( \Fun{\Empty}{\Empty} \).
%
Note that both the unit type and the empty types are made cumulative, that is
because they are used as terminal cases for the computation of
observational equality, which can live at any level.

\subsection{Setoid equality and Type Casts}
A central feature of \SetoidTT is that every proof-relevant type comes equipped with a
proof-irrelevant equality type, noted $\Path[A]{t}{u}$ (Rule~\nameref{infrule:eq-form}) and
%
a canonical way to inhabit it, by the reflexivity term $\refl{t}{A}$ (Rule~\nameref{infrule:refl}).
%
It is not necessary to equip proof-irrelevant types with
a propositional equality, as two terms would always be propositional equal
by reflexivity.
%
As we will see in the definition of reduction (\cref{fig:SetoidTT-reduction}), the equality type
of \SetoidTT should not be seen as a type constructor like
the identity type of \MLTT, but rather as a type eliminator that
computes on its type argument and possibly on its two end points.

For this equality type to be of any use, we need to be able to
eliminate it as well.
%
The usual \( J \)-eliminator defined in \MLTT can be defined in our
context, but if the predicate is proof-relevant, there will be no hope
for the eliminator to compute on reflexivity: since equality types are
proof irrelevant, there is no reduction of equality proofs, and we
cannot do pattern matching on the equality proof either. In order to
avoid this issue, we restrict the use of \( J \) to proof-irrelevant
predicates only, and note it $\transportName$
(Rule~\nameref{infrule:transport-prop}).
%
Note that in this setting, the non-dependent version of the eliminator
would be enough, as one can prove the contractibility of singletons
for free thanks to proof-irrelevance \sidecite{hottbook}.
%
Using $\transportName$, we can derive the usual groupoid
laws provided by the \( J \) eliminator, and we note $\sym{e}$ for
the inverse of $e$, \( \transitivity{e}{e'} \) for the transitivity,
and $\ap{f}{e}$ for the preservation of equality by non-dependent
function.

To deal with elimination of equality in a proof relevant context, we
introduce a cast primitive that handles transport between two
propositionally equal proof relevant types.
%
Note that our cast operation also applies to proof-irrelevant
types (Rule~\nameref{infrule:cast}).
%
This is unnecessary as Rule~\nameref{infrule:transport-prop} subsumes
this case, but it will allow us to write more uniform reduction rules.
%
The term \( \cast{A}{B}{e}{t} \) is an eliminator that reduces the types
\( A \) and \( B \) in weak-head normal form, then reduces by
pattern-matching on their head constructors. This will be explained in
more detail in the next section.
%
When applied to reflexivity, \( \castName \) does not compute as the
identity function, but this equality is propositionally admissible
as witnessed by $\castreflName$ (Rule~\nameref{infrule:cast-refl}).



Conversion (\cref{fig:SetoidTT-conversion}) subsumes reduction
(\nameref{inferrule:red-conv}), $\eta$-equality of functions
(Rule~\nameref{infrule:eta}), and proof-irrelevance
(Rule~\nameref{infrule:proof-irrelevance}).
%
It is also closed under reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity and congruence.
%
Note that $\eta$-equality does not need to be defined when the
codomain is in \( \sProp \), because of proof-irrelevance.
%
Congruence rules are standard and presented in
\cref{sec:congr-subst-rules}, \cref{fig:SetoidTT-congruence}.


\cref{fig:SetoidTT-reduction} describes the reduction in
\SetoidTT. Note that since reduction is typed,
one needs to add a rule for type conversion
(Rule~\nameref{inferrule:conv-red}).
%
Reduction features the usual notion of $\beta$-reduction
(Rule~\nameref{inferrule:beta-red}), which corresponds to the
computation rule of application (the eliminator of dependent
functions) applied to a $\lambda$-term (the constructor of dependent
functions).
%
Similarly, rules \nameref{inferrule:nat-elim-zero} and
\nameref{inferrule:nat-elim-suc} describe the two computation rules
of the eliminator of $\Nat$, one for each constructor of $\Nat$.

As mentioned previously, the equality type and type cast operation of
\SetoidTT are eliminators, and thus must come with their
computation rules.
%
Since $\Path[A]{t}{u}$ is an eliminator for the universe, it needs rules
for every type constructor.
%
Rule \nameref{inferrule:eq-fun} is the computation rule for dependent
functions which stipulates that two functions are equal when they
are pointwise equal, thus naturally providing \SetoidTT with
function extensionality.
%
Rule \nameref{inferrule:eq-sprop} says that two proof irrelevant
types are equal when they are logically equivalent, thus
providing \SetoidTT with propositional extensionality. Note that
cumulativity is required for this reduction rule to preserve typing,
as the types $A$ and $B$ live in a universe below $\Path[{\sProp[i]}]{A}{B}$.

There are three reduction rules for equality in \( \Type \).
Rule \nameref{inferrule:eq-univ} stipulates that when the two
endpoints are both $\Nat$ or the same universe, the equality holds,
which is captured by the fact that it reduces to the unit type.
%
Rule \nameref{inferrule:eq-univ-noeq} says that when the two end
points do not have the same head $\head{}$, the equality does not hold, which
is captured by the fact that it reduces to the empty type. The
function $\head{A}$ is simply equal to $\Nat$ or $\Type[i]{}$ when
$A$ is the type of natural numbers or a universe respectively, and is
defined as $(\Pi, s, i, j)$ when $A$ is the type $\Depfunannotated{A}{B}{s}{i}{j}$.
%
The third rule (Rule \nameref{inferrule:eq-pi}) says that
two dependent function types are equal when their domain are equal,
and their codomain are pointwise equal (as type families) up to
the equality on their domain.
% The reader familiar with homotopy type
% theory will recognize the usual characterization of equality on
% dependent function types in presence of univalence \sidecitet{hottbook},

As for Rule \nameref{inferrule:eq-sprop}, this rule is well-typed
only in presence of cumulativity.

There are four rules for equality in \( \Nat \), corresponding
to every possible normal forms of the endpoints. Equality holds
when both endpoints are $\zero$ (Rule \nameref{inferrule:eq-zero}),
computes to the equality of arguments when both endpoints are successors (Rule
\nameref{inferrule:eq-suc}), and does not hold otherwise
(Rules \nameref{inferrule:eq-zero-suc} and \nameref{inferrule:eq-suc-zero}).
This concludes the reduction rules for equality.

We can now turn to the description of the computation rules for type
cast, which only need to be defined when the types are
compatible---otherwise the cast will be stuck.\footnote{An alternative
  design would be to reduce to an elimination on the proof of equality which in this case
has type $\Empty$.}
%
Casting from $\Nat$ to $\Nat$ is defined by recursion to be the identity
on constructors (Rules \nameref{inferrule:cast-zero} and
\nameref{inferrule:cast-suc}), and casting a type from a universe to
the same universe is the identity\footnote{We could also define it by recursion. It is not clear whether it makes any significant
difference.}
(Rule \nameref{inferrule:cast-univ}).
%
Finally, casting between two dependent products is more involved: it
produces a new function by casting back and forth the argument and return
value of the original function (Rule \nameref{inferrule:cast-pi}).





For our definition of reduction to be complete, we need to add rules that
reduce the scrutinees of eliminators to {\em weak-head normal form} (whnf),
so the eliminator can then reduce by case analysis on the whnf.
%
Weak-head normal forms correspond to relevant terms that can \emph{not} be
reduced (\cref{fig:whnf-neutral}).
%
They are either terms with a constructor in head position, or a neutral term, which
correspond to the stuck terms that can not exist in an empty
context. Neutral terms are either variables, eliminators applied to another neutral
term, or obtained from an inhabitant of \( \Empty \).
%
In \SetoidTT, inhabitants of a proof-irrelevant type are never
considered as whnf, as there is no notion of reduction of
proof-irrelevant terms.
%
Substitution rules that implement reduction of scrutinees to weak-head normal
form are described in \cref{sec:congr-subst-rules}, \cref{fig:SetoidTT-substitution}.

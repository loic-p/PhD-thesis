\section{the two problems being solved}

Intensional computation with extensional principles

Normalization of proof-irrelevant impredicative universe with elimination of false and equality

\section{history of setoids}

Hofmann : Extensional concepts in intensional type theory (PhD thesis, 95)

First model of ETT in ITT. Does not support universes because no proof-relevant equality.

Altenkirch : Extensional Equality in Intensional Type Theory (LICS99)

Full model of ETT in ITT + sProp, using CwF of setoids.

Altenkirch, McBride : 

Altenkirch, McBride : Observational Equality, Now! (PLPV07)

Normalization ``proof'', canonicity from consistency, proof-irrelevant axioms 
are fine, heterogeneous equality.
